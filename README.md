# CHHS_ZeroRobotics
Collaborative spot to develop the best solution for the school submission 

As you Branch from the main thread make a note in here to tell me what you are working on and What functions you are building 

You can just grab one of the functions that you think you might be able to code to and give it a go and I'll reply with some feed back if I can see some improvements.
